# Mooz

Mooz is a simple Web conferencing app that leverages WebRTC. It consists of a Go backend that acts as my singaling server
and simple HTLM/CSS/JS frontend that uses WebRTC to establish a peer-to-peer connection between two clients.

I got in terested in WebRTC and building this project after listening to Sean DuBois' interview on FLOSS
Weekly. You can find the episode [here](https://hackaday.com/2024/01/17/floss-weekly-episode-766-webrtc-the-hack-that-connects-everyone-to-everything/).
